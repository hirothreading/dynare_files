# Dynare .mod files
These are some Dynare .mod files for various macroeconomic DSGE models I've looked at throughout my studies.
Many of the .mod files on my computer are not yet ready for public use (messy code, custom if-then-else statements and so on). My goal is to
clean these up and then upload them.

For those looking for more reference .mod files for their macro DSGE research, then I encourage you to take a look at the amazing work by
[Johannes Pfeifer](https://github.com/JohannesPfeifer/DSGE_mod) and the entire [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org/about/) team.

## Replication issues or feedback
