# A Baseline RBC Model

## Ramsey social planner problem

Consider a Hansen-style RBC model. Final good firms use the production
function $Y_t = A_tK_{t-1}^\alpha L_t^{1-\alpha}$. The representative
household utility function is
$u(C_t,L_t) = \ln C_t - \chi L^{1+\nu^{-1}}/(1+\nu^{-1})$. Set
$\alpha=0.3$, $\nu=2$, $\chi=4.5$, $\beta=0.99$, $\delta=0.025$,
$\rho_a=0.95$, and $\sigma_a=0.01$.  

As there are no distortions, we can solve the model from the perspective
of the Ramsey social planner who aims to maximise the representative household's future present discounted value of utility.
