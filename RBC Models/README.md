# RBC Models
In this repository you will find some example RBC models. The first is a baseline Hansen-style RBC model that is often used in first-year postgraduate courses in macroeconomics. The second adds in financial frictions in the form of a financial intermediary -- in line with Gertler-Kiyotaki or Gertler-Karadi -- to the RBC model. 

I hope to add more versions of the RBC model as I write more material for teaching.
