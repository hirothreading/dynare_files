# RBC Model with Financial Frictions  

Please read the PDF for a complete derivation of the model. I have calibrated the model so that banks have a leverage ratio of approximately 4 in steady state.  

Note: You will need to download and place the s_find.m in the same directory as your Dynare mod file. It assists Dynare's steady state solver to compute the steady state.
